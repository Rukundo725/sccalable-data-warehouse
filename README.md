# sensor_data_warehouse

## summary:

This project is about  to create an AI startup that deploys sensors to businesses, collects data from all activities in a business - from people’s interaction to the smart appliances installed in the company to reading environmental and other relevant information. the startup is responsible to install all the required sensors, receive a stream of data from all sensors.
In this challenge we creted a scalable data warehouse tech-stack that will help in providing the AI service to the client.
